# Documentation

Pre-built API documentation is not provided with the PHP classes, but you can generate API documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder of this project, and documentation will be generated in this folder. You will need to have [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed, though you will already have that if you installed the library using composer with dev modules enabled. The configuration for phpdoc is in the [phpdoc.dist.xml file].

Further help and information is available in README, the examples folder, and in the GitHub wiki.

Fixes and additions to documentation are welcome - please submit pull requests or improve wiki pages.
